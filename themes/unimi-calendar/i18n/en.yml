Click on <code>View timetable</code> button and wait for the timetable to load. Once the page has loaded, copy the url of the page from the address bar of your browser and paste it below.

The timetable calendar can then be added to your app via the functionality \"calendar subscription\".</p><p>This site does a trivial job and there are others ways to get the same link.</p>"
